# Hello there. This is my first try with React.

Built with passion, yes, but also coffee and cool components I've found online.


## Here's what I worked with:

| category     | stuff I actually used                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend** | React â€¢ TypeScript â€¢ Vite / Create React App |
| **Styling**  | Tailwind CSS â€¢ SCSS                          |
| **Deploy**   | GitHub Pages / Vercel                        |
| **Extra**    | Some cool stuf by ReactBits                  |

## What I wanted to create

- ðŸŒˆ **Cool stuff** for users to see and interact with
- ðŸ§­ **React code** that actually works
- âš¡ **A nice, new webfolio** because i needed that.

I'll go back to my Clair Obscur run. Cya!
